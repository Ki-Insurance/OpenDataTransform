Testing
================

Testing guidelines and processes are currently under preparation, in collaboration with the Catastrophe Resiliency Council (coordinated by The Institutes).

These will include:

* Templates for recording the type of exposure data being transformed and complexity of portfolios. 
* Templates for recording the results of transformation to assess it's performance. 
* A standard process for tracking the successful conversion of portfolios, and to highlight problems in transformations, to improve the framework in the future.

The templates and processes will also be used to enable data validation in the planned user interface.
