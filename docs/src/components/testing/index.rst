Testing
================

Testing guidelines and processes are currently under preparation, in collaboration with the Climate Resiliency Council (cooridinated by The Institutes).

The guidelines will include:

* Templates for recording the type of exposure data being transformed and complexity of portfolios. 
* Templates for recording the results of transformation to assess it's performance. 

These templates may then be used in a user interface enabling users to validate the exported data.
