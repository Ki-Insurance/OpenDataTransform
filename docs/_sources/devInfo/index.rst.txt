Developer information
==========================

The Open Data Transformation is designed to convert exposure data from one format to another as long as both formats can be expressed as an iterable of dictionaries. That is, the possible field values must be mapped to a key (field name) for each model format.

The convertor framework is modular, using several swappable components:

* Data Connections for specifying how the input and output data should be processed by the system. The current version support csv file input and output as csv files only, but a new connection could enable, for example, extracting data directly from a model database.

* Mapping describing how the fields should be transformed to between formats.

* The Runner, which takes the input connection, transforms the data using the mapping and passes the transformed data onto the output connection.

Each of these components are configurable and even swappable to some new implementation.
